Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.

If you are training multi-class SVMs with the one-vs-all method, it isnot possible to use a kernel.

The maximum value of the Gaussian kernel (i.e., sim(x, l^{(1)})sim(x,l(1))) is 1.

Suppose you have 2D input examples (ie, x^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^2x(i)∈R2). The decision boundary of the SVM (with the linear kernel) is a straight line.

If the data are linearly separable, an SVM using a linear kernel willreturn the same parameters \thetaθ regardless of the chosen value ofCC (i.e., the resulting value of \thetaθ does not depend on CC).
